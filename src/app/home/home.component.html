								Connection</h2>
							<p style="font-size: 17px; text-align:justify">The first pan-Indian
								empire at its peak - sometime in the second century BC - Magadh was a
								cradle for knowledge in ancient India. It remained the centre of culture
								and learning in India for almost thousand years starting about 5th
								century BC. During this period there was rapid progress in politics,
								economics, literature, religion, and philosophy. While eminent centres
								of learning like Nalanda and Vikramshila universities flourished in
								Magadh, two great religions - Buddhism and Jainism, too were founded
								there.</p>

							<p style="font-size: 17px; text-align:justify">Magadh also saw some
								brilliant developments in the fields of mathematics, astrology,
								astronomy, warfare and medicine. Large parts of this era were marked by
								relative peace which was facilitated by the farsightedness of the
								leaders of the empire who focused on efficient mitigation of external
								and internal threats.</p>

							<p style="font-size: 17px; text-align:justify">This approach to life - of
								deep thinking, seeking wisdom, solid execution, and risk management -
								inspires us in every aspect of our philosophy and process at Magadh
								Capital. In our pursuit for excellence in fund management, this approach
								also helps us in our attempt to develop a mindset which seeks to
								identify facts, and their relationships.</p>

          <li>
            <strong>Integrity and transparency –</strong>

					<h2>INVESTMENT <span style="text-transform:uppercase;"
							class="text-primary">Framework</span></h2>
					<p style="text-align:justify">Magadh Capital’s portfolio construction is
						based on its proprietary FACTS boxes validation process which optimizes
						the risk-reward profile of the portfolio. The stock selection process is
						an intensive one based on a combination of qualitative as well as
						quantitative measures.</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify">We follow a conventional, disciplined
						approach backed by fundamental bottom-up/top-down research to identify
						good stocks with moderate risks at fair price. We are keen for contrarian
						opportunities if we see strength in a company that is being missed by the
						market for some reversible reasons.<br> Ours is a blend of growth and
						value styles. We look to figure out a stock’s fair value in a range backed
						by our fundamental equity research process and thus attempt to identify
						instances of market mispricing. DCF (Discounted cash flow) method forms
						the core of our valuation exercise though we do apply other methods
						too.</p>

					<h2>RISK <span style="text-transform:uppercase;"
							class="text-primary">MANAGEMENT</span></h2>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">We work with the understanding that markets
						are inherently risky. We see possibility of permanent capital erosion or
						of poor returns in the long run as the central risk factor and strive to
						minimize this risk - as our first goal. Magadh Capital does not see stock
						price dip due to short term volatility as a measure or indicator of risk.
						<br>
						Our investment philosophy and style have been influenced heavily by our
						focus on alleviation of risks in our pursuit for wealth creation for our
						investors. Our investment process is designed to assist us in identifying
						key risk factors, in trying to estimate the range of probabilities for
						various risk factors, and in thinking of impact of those risk factors. At
						the same time, while we score well on the scale of risk aversion, we are
						not loss averse over near term especially if we are convinced regarding
						long term opportunities.
