                                            <p>Blaise Pascal, the famous French
                                                physicist of the 17th century,
                                                had once said “All of humanity’s
                                                problems stem from man’s
                                                inability to sit quietly in a
                                                room alone.”
                                                <br /> Understandably it is not
                                                easy to extol the virtues of
                                                laziness, or even of selective
                                                inaction. However, if laziness
                                                is resorted to consciously, with
                                                full control over oneself, in

                                                wonders towards attainment of
                                                goals and achievement of
                                                happiness. It can be of immense
                                                value for people in fields as
                                                wide ranging as sports,
                                                investments, science,

                                                Kahneman, Nobel laureate in

                                                asked for his favorite equation.
                                                Napolean Bonaparte had once
                                                quipped “I’d rather have a lucky
                                                general than a good one.”

                                                <br /> Regression to mean (RTM)
                                                is one such phenomenon which in
                                                a sense is manifestation of
                                                luck. Understandably RTM
                                                provides the philosophical
                                                underpinnings for many

                                                one-to-two-years’ perspective.
                                                Shorter-term, obviously, it is
                                                very difficult to take a call
                                                and also it is futile to take a
                                                shorter-term call. The one thing

                                                is what to do in the markets.
                                                Last nine months, the trailing
                                                performance has been phenomenal.
                                                There is no doubt that. 2023 was
                                                quite good. </p>

                                        Here we list down some books that we
                                        believe can add value to the repertoire
                                        of an investor. Notably, we have not yet
                                        read many of these books though they are
                                        in our bucket list. On the other hand,
                                        we have read many of these books more
                                        than once and some of them act as
